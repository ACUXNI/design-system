**Codename:** `ChoiceToggleButtonGroup` - NationalInstruments.Controls.Shell

Function like radio or individual toggle buttons but have an appearance similar to Toggle Buttons (Think of text justification buttons). These should look exactly like the button.  These will NEVER have text. Only images should be used.  If an image isn't informative enough, use a regular radio button group.

Used in text formatting (B, I, S, U) as individual toggles
