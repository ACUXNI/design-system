While group boxes can be a way to visually create relationships between controls, they can cause a simple interface to look overly complex.

**Pro:** Strong way to indicate relationships.  
**Con:** Overusing them adds visual clutter.

### Alternatives

Instead of group boxes, try using layout to communicate relationships. Place related controls next to each other and put extra spacing between unrelated controls. Use headings and indenting to show hierarchical relationships.

Using a separator is lighter weight and provides a cleaner look.
If you find you must use a group box:

- Don’t nest group boxes.
- Don’t put controls in group box labels 
- Don’t disable group boxes. Instead, disable all the controls inside the group box, but not the group box itself.
- Label all group boxes.
- Watch for redundancy with the group box label and the control labels.
