    allow direct manipulation for common actions<br />
    provide a means to apply settings across multiple objects (batch operations)<br />

    be cautious when making assumptions about what users want<br />
  </p>

  <h2>Modern</h2>
  <p>Modernize without losing the goodness of what came before</p>
  <p>
    use common, famibrar interaction and visual patterns<br />  
    strive for migration of functionabrty, not parity of interactions<br />  
    balance between famibrarity and innovation<br />
