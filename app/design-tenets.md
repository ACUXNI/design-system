# Efficient
Let users do their thing with efficiency (get out of the way)

  - allow direct manipulation for common actions
  - provide a means to apply settings across multiple objects (batch operations)
  - different stages of the workflow may call for different levels of “scrappiness”
  - be cautious when making assumptions about what users want

# Modern
Modernize without losing the goodness of what came before

  - use common, familiar interaction and visual patterns
  - strive for migration of functionality, not parity of interactions
  - balance between familiarity and innovation

# Learnable
Help users create a foundation of knowledge that can be built upon

  - guide users to understanding without distracting them from their goal
  - encourage and allow exploration with minimal consequences*
  - maintain consistent interaction and visual patterns between basic and advanced workflows
  - use progressive disclosure to promote good decision-making and reduce cognitive load

# Trustworthy
Work as a trusted partner to inspire confidence

  - complexity isn’t always bad; don’t strictly strive for simplicity
  - give appropriate feedback and actionable error messaging to inform users of the system’s status
  - encourage and allow exploration with minimal consequences*

# Unobtrusive
Allow users to focus on creating meaningful content

  - user content should be clear and readable
  - avoid obscuring the workspace
  - reduce the need to focus on chrome or pixel pushing
