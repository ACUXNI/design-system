## README

A [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) theme built with [Google's Polymer library](https://www.polymer-project.org/1.0/) and following the material design specifications. (Currently, this uses Polymer 1.x, but I have plans to update to 2.x.)

There are a few custom web components included designed to match Material design.

I created this theme because I couldn't figure out how to set up a Jekyll project to play nicely with Polymer, and because I didn't find any Jekyll blog themes available that used Polymer or followed Google's material design specifications.
